# bills-pente

Bill's Pente Program plays the game of Pente. You can play against the computer, against another person sitting next to you, or against somebody on another computer across the internet!

It has a good X11 GUI interface, but it will run with a curses interface if you don't have X windows. For the truly primitive Pente player, you can run it in pure text mode. Yes, you can even play on your 1970s-era teletype if you really want to.

Pente has multi-language support, and currently can be used in French, English, or Italian. 

Bill's Pente Program was written in C by William Shubert.

This is a fork of the software package currently maintained by Debian Games at https://salsa.debian.org/games-team/pente
